## My process

I started with the HTML and then started with CSS and tried to go top to bottom, while thinking about how the 
image correlates with what CSS to use and configure. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learned that a mobile first approach might be the best way to tackle screens like this or any site because it can get
frustrating trying to make things not crammed and resposnive.

### Continued development

I would like to work on responsive design
